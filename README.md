# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This project is a detailed exploration of how machine learning, combined with the mathematical foundation of linear algebra, can address real-world challenges in healthcare. By leveraging the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, we developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters.
